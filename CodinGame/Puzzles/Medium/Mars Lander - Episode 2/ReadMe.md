# Mars Lander - Episode 2

[Codin Game - Mars Lander - Episode 2](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/mars-lander-episode-2)

## The Goal

The goal for your program is to safely land the "Mars Lander" shuttle, the landing ship which contains the Opportunity rover. Mars Lander is guided by a program, and right now the failure rate for landing on the NASA simulator is unacceptable.

**This puzzle is the second level of the "Mars Lander" trilogy. The controls are the same as the previous level but you must now control the angle in order to succeed.**

## Rules

Built as a game, the simulator puts Mars Lander on a limited zone of Mars sky.

The zone is `7000m` wide and `3000m` high.

There is a **unique area of flat ground** on the surface of Mars, which is at least `1000` meters wide.

**Every second**, depending on the current flight parameters (location, speed, fuel ...), the program must provide the new desired tilt angle and thrust power of Mars Lander:

Angle goes from `-90°` to `90°` . Thrust power goes from `0` to `4`.

The game simulates **a free fall** without atmosphere. Gravity on Mars is `3.711 m/s²` . For a **thrust power of X**, a push force equivalent to X m/s² is generated and **X liters of fuel** are consumed. As such, a thrust power of `4` in an almost vertical position is needed to compensate for the gravity on Mars.

For a landing to be successful, the ship must:

* land on flat ground
* land in a vertical position (tilt angle = 0°)
* vertical speed must be limited ( ≤ 40m/s in absolute value)
* horizontal speed must be limited ( ≤ 20m/s in absolute value)

## Note

Tests and validators are only slightly different. A program that passes a given test will pass the corresponding validator without any problem.

## Game Input

The program must first read the initialization data from standard input. Then, within an infinite loop, the program must read the data from the standard input related to Mars Lander's current state and provide to the standard output the instructions to move Mars Lander.

### Initialization input

**Line 1:** the number `surfaceN` of points used to draw the surface of Mars.
Next `surfaceN` lines: a couple of integers `landX` `landY` providing the coordinates of a ground point. By linking all the points together in a sequential fashion, you form the surface of Mars which is composed of several segments. For the first point, `landX = 0` and for the last point, `landX = 6999`

### Input for one game turn

A **single line** with 7 integers: `X` `Y` `hSpeed` `vSpeed` `fuel` `rotate` `power`

* `X`,`Y` are the coordinates of Mars Lander (in meters).
* `hSpeed` and `vSpeed` are the horizontal and vertical speed of Mars Lander (in m/s). These can be negative depending on the direction of Mars Lander.
* `fuel` is the remaining quantity of fuel in liters. When there is no more fuel, the `power` of thrusters falls to zero.
* `rotate` is the angle of rotation of Mars Lander expressed in degrees.
* power is the thrust power of the landing ship.

### Output for one game turn

A **single line** with 2 integers: `rotate` `power` :

*`rotate` is the desired rotation angle for Mars Lander. Please note that for each turn the actual value of the angle is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 15°.
*`power` is the desired thrust power. 0 = off. 4 = maximum power. Please note that for each turn the value of the actual power is limited to the value of the previous turn +/- 1.

### Constraints

2 ≤ `surfaceN` < 30
0 ≤ `X` < 7000
0 ≤ `Y` < 3000
-500 < `hSpeed`, `vSpeed` < 500
0 ≤ `fuel` ≤ 2000
-90 ≤ `rotate` ≤ 90
0 ≤ `power` ≤ 4
Response time per turn ≤ 100ms

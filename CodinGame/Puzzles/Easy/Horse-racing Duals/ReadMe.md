[Codin Game - Horse-racing Duals](https://www.codingame.com/ide/puzzle/horse-racing-duals)

## The Goal

Casablanca’s hippodrome is organizing a new type of horse racing: duals. During a dual, only two horses will participate in the race. In order for the race to be interesting, it is necessary to try to select two horses with similar strength.

Write a program which, using a given number of strengths, identifies the two closest strengths and shows their difference with an integer (≥ 0).

## Game Input

### Input

Line 1: Number `N` of horses

The `N` following lines: the strength `Pi` of each horse. `Pi` is an integer.

### Output

The difference `D` between the two closest strengths. `D` is an integer greater than or equal to 0.

### Constraints

1 < `N`  < 100000
0 < `Pi` ≤ 10000000

## Example

### Example - Input

```sh
